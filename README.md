# Editable-text-effects-for-Inkscape

With Inkscape version 1.3 (and above) you can make editable text effects.
I made some text effects I want to share for learning purposes. Please do not sell them. 
Inspiration came from images and tutorials on the internet.
Note that some browsers do not display well some fonts.

Instructions:
To edit the text and/or change the font:
  1) select the '--> edit text here'-object.
  2) open the text tool and change the text and/or font.
  3) eventually adjust leading, kerning and tracking.
  4) add a space-character at the end of the text and delete it to update the text effect (be patient, this can take some time).
  5) eventually change colours of fills and strokes; then repeat step 4).
Save and export to png-file.

Colour palette and background are locked: unlock to change.
Fonts used here are Lobster, EngravingCC, Badaboom, Open Sans Bold and Comfortaa Light. Please check licenses before using these fonts.
